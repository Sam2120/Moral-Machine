Moral Machine Simulator â€“ Project Overview

This project is a simulation tool designed to mimic ethical decision-making scenarios in autonomous vehicles. Developed as part of a course on Object-Oriented Programming, it allows users to explore how self-driving cars might handle life-and-death decisions.

The program is structured into four key components:

Data Classes: Defines Person and Scenario classes to represent individuals (e.g., child, adult, criminal, pregnant) and the overall setup (passengers, pedestrians, barricade).

Input & Generation: Offers both manual and random options to create passengers and pedestrians with diverse attributes.

Decision Logic: Scores each group using ethical values (e.g., doctors have higher scores, criminals are penalized) to decide whether the car should stay its course or swerve.

Visualization: Uses matplotlib to display the scenario graphically, showing the positions of passengers, pedestrians, and any barricade.

The main execution prompts users to generate a scenario, processes the input, makes an ethical decision, and visually presents the outcome.
